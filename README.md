# GitHub Action for CI/CD

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a GitHub Action workflow to automate Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes.

## Overview

The GitHub Action workflow defined in this repository automates the CI/CD pipeline by executing a series of steps whenever code is pushed to the repository or a pull request is opened. This ensures that the application is automatically built, tested, and deployed, maintaining code quality and facilitating rapid delivery.

## Workflow Details

The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file and includes the following key steps:

1. **Triggering Events**: The workflow is triggered on `push` and `pull_request` events to the `main` branch.

2. **Job Execution**: It runs on the latest Ubuntu environment (`ubuntu-latest`) and includes the following steps:

   - **Checkout Code**: Utilizes the `actions/checkout@v2` action to clone the repository.

   - **Set Up Node.js**: Uses the `actions/setup-node@v2` action to set up Node.js version 14.

   - **Install Dependencies**: Runs `npm install` to install project dependencies.

   - **Run Tests**: Executes `npm test` to run the test suite.

   - **Build Project**: Runs `npm run build` to build the project.

   - **Deploy Application**: Uses the `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` action to deploy the application to GitHub Pages.

## Usage

To utilize this workflow in your own repository:

1. **Create Workflow Directory**: Ensure you have a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.

2. **Add Workflow File**: Create a `ci.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory.

3. **Define Workflow**: Copy the workflow definition from this repository's `ci.yml` file into your own.

4. **Customize as Needed**: Modify the workflow steps to suit your project's specific requirements.
